# ‚òï Coffee Machine Simulation using OOP

This project is a console-based simulation of a coffee machine built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows users to select drinks, processes payments, checks ingredient availability, and simulates coffee preparation.

---

## Features

- Offers 3 types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
- Tracks resources (water, milk, coffee) and updates inventory after each transaction.
- Processes coin-based payments and returns change if needed.
- Provides a report of current resources and profits.
- Clean, modular design using classes and OOP principles.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OOP concepts: Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation

---

##  Project Structure

- `menu.py` ‚Äì Defines drink menu and their ingredients.
- `menu_item.py` ‚Äì Represents individual drinks and their data.
- `coffee_maker.py` ‚Äì Handles coffee making logic and resource checks.
- `money_machine.py` ‚Äì Manages payment processing and money tracking.
- `main.py` ‚Äì Main program loop that connects all components.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bhuvangowda02/coffemachine-oop.git
    cd coffemachine-oop
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

##  OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation:** Each component (e.g., money, coffee maker, menu) is encapsulated in its own class.
- **Abstraction:** Simplified user interaction hides internal logic.
- **Modularity:** Each file has a clear responsibility.
- **Scalability:** Easily add new drinks or features.
